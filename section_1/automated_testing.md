# Automated Testing

Testing code is important - buggy software will drive your customers to your competitors. But manual testing is costly, repetitive, and prone to human error. Using automated testing tools to catch bugs during development significantly reduces the cost of failure and saves time through repeatability and earlier code verification. Companies can then leverage the improved resources for productivity.

Automated testing can quickly provide a measurable ROI:
