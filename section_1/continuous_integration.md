# Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests.

This practice helps detect new errors quickly and locate them more easily, saving costly and lengthy revisions later in development.
