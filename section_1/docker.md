# Docker

Docker is a platform used by developers to develop, build, distribute, test, and deploy an application. Docker containers are lightweight, portable, self-contained environments where software runs independently of other software installed on the host machine. This allows developers to easily share code with their colleagues for development and testing, and provides an easy package to deploy to customers.

Companies utilizing Docker do not need to maintain multiple virtual machines for each project. Their developers do not need to manage dedicated environments for their development, testing, staging, etc. Docker allows developers to focus on development, and not the management of the development environment.

Docker containers enable rapid, iterative development and testing cycles, greatly increasing productivity. As an example, when the London-based *Financial Times* adopted Docker for their website development in 2015, they were able to cut server costs by 80% and increase their productivity from 12 releases per year to over 2,200.
