# Git

With its robust [branching](/section_3/branch.md) capabilities, Git can significantly increase a company's productivity. Developers can work individually on separate features within unique branches without affecting the production codebase on the main branch. Once features are production ready, they can be [merged](/section_3/merge.md) back into the main branch.

This distributed development approach enables multiple features to be developed in parallel, which can help give a company a competitive edge in time to market.
