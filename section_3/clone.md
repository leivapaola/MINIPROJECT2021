# Clone
A clone is a full copy of a Repository from a server that exists on your local device. This allows you to make edits to your project without needing an active connection to the remote server. Changes are made locally using the editor of your choice. You can then stage, commit, and push your changes back to the remote server.

## Examples
`git clone URL` where URL is the address of a git project.
