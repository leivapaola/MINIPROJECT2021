# Fork

Forking a repository copies the project to your workspace. You can then make changes and experiment without affecting the original.

## Examples

### Fix bugs in another project
Instead of submitting an issue you've discovered to the developer, you could fix it yourself. You would do this by forking the repository, making the fix, and submitting a pull request to the original project owner.

### Create a new project using an existing one as a starting point
You don't always need to start a project from scratch. If there's an existing project that would work as a base for your idea, you can fork it and have a solid foundation to start from.
