# Repository
The starting point for it all. A repository contains all files for the project, including revision history. Repositories are generally stored on a remote server, and are cloned to a local device for development. Multiple authors can collaborate seamlessly on a single repository through the use of branching.

## Examples
 `git init` This will create a new empty repository on your local device.

 `git remote add origin URL` This specifies the remote repository for your local repository. URL refers to the GitHub address.
